This means that there are so many possible values that you could've used to compute your public key that it's impossible to try all the possible values and thereby \"steal\" your keys and your Bitcoin. Finding a private key for a public key is like asking someone to pick a random atom from all the atoms in a billion galaxies, then scrambling those atoms up completely randomly, also choosing an atom at random and ending up with the same atom.
